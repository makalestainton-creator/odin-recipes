  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>A classic lasagna is a baked Italian dish consisting
     of alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, a 
     rich meat sauce (ragù or bolognese), a creamy cheese
      filling (ricotta mixture or béchamel sauce), and
       melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. The dish
        is baked until hot, bubbly, and golden brown on
         top, then allowed to rest before serving to
          ensure clean slices. </p>

          <h4>Steps</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and
                 garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat
                  until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce,
                 tomato paste, and water. Season with
                  sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 
                  1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                  fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer,
                   covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring
                    occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water
                 to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling
                  water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles,
                   and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese 
                with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley,
                 and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F 
                (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat
                 sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
                  dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over
                   meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread
                    with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                     Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                      Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
                       and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining 
                mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with
                 foil: to prevent sticking, either spray
                  foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
                  foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
                 Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
          </ol>
