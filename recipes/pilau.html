  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Pilau (or pilaf) refers to long-grain basmati rice
     with a rich, aromatic spice blend (pilau masala)
      and meat or vegetable stock, using a specific 
      technique to ensure the grains are fluffy and
       separate, not sticky or mushy. The key to its 
       characteristic brown color and deep flavor is the
        caramelization of onions. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon cloves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon black peppercorn seeds</li>
            <li>12 pods Cardamon</li>
            <li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>5 potatoes medium size [peeled and cut into quarters]</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 Red onions medium size [thinly sliced]</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ginger minced</li>
            <li>1 serrano chile finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pilau masala</li>
            <li>2 beef stock cubes</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 Roma tomatoes diced</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li2>Bay leaves</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
           <li>Place the cumin, black peppers, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves in a dry pan.</li> 
           <li>Roast over low heat until warmed through and fragrant and blend (I used a coffee grinder) until smooth.</li>
           <li>You need just 1 to 11/2 tablespoons for this recipe (depending on how fragrant you want the rice to be). Feel free to store the leftover spice powder in an airtight container for up to 3 months, or refrigerate for up to 6 months.</li>
           <li>Heat a stockpot on medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
           <li>Add the sliced onions and fry for 10-15 minutes or till the onions starts to turn golden brown (be careful not to burn it).</li>
           <li>Add the garlic, ginger, serrano pepper, Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
           <li>Add the cubed beef, pilau masala, beef stock cubes, bay leaves, cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat browns and caramelizes stirring occasionally about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
           <li>Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have released their liquid.</li>
           <li>Stir in the potatoes and the water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
           <li>Stir in the rice, and cover tightly with a foil paper (to keep the steam in) if necessary. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
           <li>Once the rice is dry, remove the foil paper and fluff with a fork to ensure the seasonings are well distributed all around the rice.</li>
           <li>Serve hot with fresh Kachumbari-salsa. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
