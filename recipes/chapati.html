  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Chapati is an unleavened flatbread originating
     from the Indian subcontinent, typically made with
      whole wheat flour (atta), water, and optional salt
       or oil, and cooked on a flat skillet (tawa). </p> 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
       <li> 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)</li>
       <li>¾ to 1 cup warm or hot water (adjust 
        as needed, flour types vary)</li>
       <li>¼ tsp salt (optional)</li>
       <li>tbsp oil or ghee (optional, for softer chapatis)</li> 
       <li> dry flour for dusting</li>
       <li>Ghee or oil for brushing the cooked chapatis (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place 3 cups of flour and add salt in large bowl.</li> 

        <li>Rub in the ghee, then gradually add the hot water, or enough to form a firm dough.</li>

        <li>Mix with a wooden spoon. If the dough is sticky, let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>If using a stand mixer, use a dough hook and let it mix for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>If kneading by hand, turn the dough on a well-flour surface and knead for 10 minutes until smooth.</li>

        <li>Should you notice that the dough is too sticky, add a little flour at a time until a firm dough form. Do not add too much flour.</li> 

        <li>Place the dough into a bowl and cover with a kitchen cloth or plastic wrap and set aside for one hour.</li>

        <li> Divide the dough into 14-16 ports and roll into 15 circles.</li>

        <li>Brush the rolled out chapati with melted ghee and form spiralled balls, repeat the process, then cover and let the oiled dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>You can also roll the dough balls into a circle, cut each circle at the centre then roll tightly to form a cone shape, press each cone shaped ball down on the pointed top.</li>

        <li>Reroll the oiled dough balls into a 15 cm (5inches) circle.</li>

        <li>Head a thick bottomed pan or tawa on medium heat.</li>

        <li>Cook one chapati at a time, dry frying each side until brown bubbles appear, then brush each side with ghee, flattening the surface with a spoon or flipper until both sides are golden brown.</li>

        <li>Repeat this process with all chapatis, cooking each side for 15-20 seconds.</li>

        <li>Place the in a clean kitchen towel, inside a bowl and cover tightly with a lid. This step will keep your chapatis warm and soft.</li>

        <li>Serve with your favourite stew.</li>
